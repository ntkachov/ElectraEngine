# Electra Engine for Android # 

This was a few weeks worth of work to try my hand at a 3D c++ rendering engine for android.
It currently supports textures, specularity. There are no plans to finish developing this. 


Feel free to use it as a learning tool for getting started with android 3d. I really couldn't 
find too many things online about how to make a 3D rendere with android using the NDK so I wrote this
using some Obj C tuts and managed to get it running on android.

Requires NDK.
